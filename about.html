I am a freshman at Pomona College. This past semester I took the courses Principles of Macroeconomics, Calculus II, Law and Lawyers in America, and Spanish. I am really excited
for next semester when I will take Introduction to CS, Sociocultural Antrhopology, Geology, and Microeconomics. I have also played the french horn for 8 years, and I will continue
playing in the Pomona College Orchestra. During the summers, I have been a counselor for Girls Rock Math, a summer camp for elementary school Girls to learn math, and attended the
University of Washington's Fosters Women's Leaderhip Summit. I also spent two weeks playing music at Western Washington University at theMarrowstone Summer Festival with the 
Seattle Symphony. A few summers ago I took an interest in computer science. I learned to code with Girls Who Code, a seven week summer immersion program dedicated to encouraging 
women to code. Through Girls Who Code, I gained the skills to code this website! I plan to do more software engineering in the future, and I hope to major in computer science and
economics.
