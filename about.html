I am a senior at Mercer Island High School. I am a part of the Marching Band and Swim & Dive Team.
I also am a member of Gender Equality Club, Asian Collective, Destination Imagination, Spanish Honor Society, and National Honor Society. Outside of school I am involved with the Seattle Youth Symphony
Orchestra as a member of the Youth orchestra. I volunteer through National Charity League with organizations like JDRF and Special Olympics. I have worked as a
Lifeguard at the Mercerwood Shore Club for two years. During the summers, I have been a counselor for Girls Rock Math (a summer camp for elementary school Girls
to learn math) and attended the University of Washington's Fosters Women's Leaderhip Summit. I also spent two weeks playing music at Western Washington University at the
Marrowstone Summer Festival with the Seattle Symphony. During the summers, I have also taken an interest in computer science. I learned to code with Girls Who Code, a
seven week summer immersion program dedicated to encouraging women to code. Through Girls Who Code, I gained the skills to code this website!
