<b> Girls Rock Math </b>
<p> I spent my summer after my freshman year of college working for Girls Rock Math, a math camp for 5-11 year old girls where they learn math and do math related art 
  projects. My role was as a Site Director, where I supervised recess, worked one on one with struggling kids, made sure all the materials were ready for each camp day, 
  and on occassion subsituted for the camp teacher. As a woman in STEM myself, it was exciting to see so many young girls already have a passion for math, and I loved
  getting to be a role model for our high school volunteer counselors as well.
